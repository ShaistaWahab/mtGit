# **Introduction And Motivation**:

It illustrate by the efforts of Mujtaba Shahin from Monash University And Muhammad Ali Babar from University of Adelaide. They work on the role of software architecture in DevOps transformation An Industrial case study.  In proceeding of international conference on software and system process (ICSSP20) at South korea, Newyork,USA. Development and Operations (DevOps) is a particular type of Software Engineering and is become a famous software. we can use this software for the authentication of the architected DevOps for the insdustrial cases. We performed industrial case study that is about to research the identification and measure phenomena for the key of architectural decisions, which are considered important to DevOps transformation synthesized by two software development teams. So, we found that the DevOps works best in the architecture and also found that working on DevOps improve the performance of the team. For this purpose the DevOps specialists must be there to perform task in perfect manner. Afterall the investment testing is mendatory for the team if they want the software changes quickly. The organization of Development and Operation (DevOps) archetype to built a software for industrial pace. However establishment of DevOps for industrial study develops industrial interest to share responsibilities and implementing its capabilities. For these purposes industrial study requires some new tools to perform all required tasks. There is an increasing amount of literatures on DevOps which deals with improving performance in developing pipeline and lookafter on other different challenges and also keeps knowledge about personal classroom use of digital/hardcopies for the industrial case study operations the expertise are required to perform operation tasks successfully. Software Architecture is the key to reach on the peak of DevOps . Mostly reported researchers are context of CD as practice of development and operation we search from other organizations existing around the globe for searching the impact on Software Architecture on case study, through this we came to know that the frame work of CD is re-architecting on CD. By analyzing and understanding these all Architectural study we founf that DevOps is the most important DevOps driven software architecture.

# **Result**:

 It is identified that industrial study has also revealed that DevOps works best with Modular Architecture, Software Architecture and DevOps all are very important for the industrial case study to introuduce new data sources and information about the system in the platform.For the improvement of performance in DevOps  we added operation specialists in the team to perform the operation task that exactky required and also invested testing in particular automated tests of DevOps popeline to release software changes faster.
