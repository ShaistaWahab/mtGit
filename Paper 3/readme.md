# **Introduction And Motivation**:
The transformation journey of my life is all about a passionate women Dr: Muneera Bano. She is a PhD scholar in software engineering and a senior lecturer of software engineering from Deakin University Austrailia. She is veteran researcher, who has earn several awards and recognization of computing, She awarded by Google Austrailia’s Anita Borg Award for Women in Computer Science, She was recipient of schlumberger’s award for women in STEM and also awarded by ‘Distinguished research paper award’ She has been announced as the superstar of STEM by science technology austrailia. Before starting her teaching career Muneera worked as a ‘Postal Doctoral Researcher’ and Learning and Teaching adjunct at the university of technology Sydney.  During the early stages of her career when she realised that she has to apply her knowledge of computing and principles to her life for this she has to daeal with every challenge and problem with the same systematic and analytical approach as she do with her computing projects. This lead to a new prespective on her life and every challenge became an adventure and learning moment. Computing and learning offer creative opportunities that can push the boundry of imaginations when we provide innovative solution to our current problems. She was fascinated by the digital world that is a universe of its own, a creationof human genius, and the impact of the technology is having an shaping society.
 As academic teaching in computing and engineering discipline she felt that there was a strong gender stereotype associated with the teaching capabilities of female faculty. She challenged those streotypes in all aspects of her academic career whether it was as a teacher, a researcher, supervisor or in leadership roles. She also specialises in the field of socio-technical domains of software engineering focusing on human-centred technologies, also worked looking for ways to engineer technology to work better with the people that use it.

 # **Result**:

  When she was awarded with a phD at the University Of Technology Sydney she said that My phD was not just a degree but a journey that I started from traveling to Austrailia from Pakistanand overcoming social, cultural and phsychological barriers to achieve my goal.
